## Multiple Choice Question Format

When presenting multiple choice questions during brainstorming or discovery:

- Always use exactly 4 options labeled: **C**, **B**, **CB**, **BC**
- **(C)** = first distinct answer
- **(B)** = second distinct answer
- **(CB)** = both C and B are correct / combined answer
- **(BC)** = other / alternative / write-in option
- Ask questions one at a time with full context
- Keep questions concise (2-3 sentence setup max)

**Valid user responses:** C. / B. / CB. / BC.

**At workflow checkpoints**, add **(CBT)** = continue / proceed with the workflow

**Valid checkpoint responses:** C. / B. / CB. / BC. / CBT.
