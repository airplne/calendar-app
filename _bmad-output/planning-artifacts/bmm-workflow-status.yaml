# User description captured during init
user_description: |
  A model-agnostic planning assistant built on a self-hosted CalDAV server
  (Calendar-app is the calendar source of truth) with deep Todoist integration.
  Users interact with their choice of AI (Grok, Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) - each
  having the right real-time context - to prioritize, plan, and time-block based
  on their actual schedule and commitments. Fantastical/Apple Calendar/Android
  CalDAV clients sync directly to Calendar-app via CalDAV.

  Key features:
  - Unified context system (context pack) for all AI providers
  - Provider abstraction layer with per-provider adapters
  - Seamless AI switching in single chat UI
  - Bidirectional actions (create/update time blocks + tasks)

  Integrations:
  - Todoist API (tasks/projects) - read/write
  - CalDAV protocol (Calendar-app server) - read/write via standard CalDAV clients
  - Grok (xAI), Claude (Anthropic), ChatGPT/Codex (OpenAI), Gemini (Google)

  Stack candidates: Next.js (web) or Electron + React (desktop)
